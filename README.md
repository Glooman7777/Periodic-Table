Hi, this is my first contribution to github.
im still in school and i made this for fun, I don't know much about coding, and i only know how to use python. but i decided to upload this as my first contribution.
if you decide to run this you have to install Puthon 3.11 and it will automatically download 2 addons, tkinter (something i use to create an interactable window)
and Pillow (something i use to render images) there is nothing that is intended to harm your PC ar all. i just wanted to share what id made.
