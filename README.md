Hi, this is my first contribution to github.
I'm still in school and I made this for fun, I don't know much about coding, and I only know how to use python. but I decided to upload this as my first contribution. If you decide to run this you have to install Puthon 3.11 and it will automatically download 2 addons, tkinter (something I use  to create an interactable window) and Pillow (something I use to render images) there is nothing that is intended to harm your PC at all. I just wanted to share what I'd made. I've also included a non zip file so you can look at the code and make sure that there isn't anything harmful being installed.
